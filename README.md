# Frontend Mentor Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) solutions repository! 

This space is a collection of the different coding challenges I've been completing to level up my frontend development skills, build modern interfaces, and practice writing clean, typed code.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

Throughout these projects, I primarily use:

* **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** for logic and interactivity.
* Semantic **HTML5**.
* Modern **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Custom Properties).
* Continuous deployment via **GitHub Pages**.
